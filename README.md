# Game-Engines-1

Due to my laptop was broken last week, and I borrowed my friend laptop and not do too much about this assignment. So this project may be simple. This is a link for youtube: https://youtu.be/gZEBy7Aqo7c

This project is about music visualization, and when click start it will display a grass ground then you will see the cubes beating to the music in front of your eyes.

And in the left hand side it also has cubes beating. I was try to do the grass with mountain, but the effect is not particularly good then I change it to like enjot music on the grass.

For the background it was changed by myself and use cubes make a circle it also make by myself. For the instanctionCube.cs, update I will reseach online and instantiation the cubes also related with notes and do some research.

For the freqenceCubes.cs it was study with video.

For the AudioVisable.cs, in the part of GetFreqenceCubes I was study with vedio. And to get AudioSource I was research online to study.
